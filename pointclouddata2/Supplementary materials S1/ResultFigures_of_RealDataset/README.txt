    These are the high resolution result images of each method on the  real datasets in the paper. Also,  pictures of the original point cloud and its ground-truth and boundary poins are given.
    There are six real dataset: Two-planes, Three-planes, Three-intersecting-planes, House, Cuboid, and Curtin314. The naming convention for the images is: datasetname-method. 
   
For example: 
Two-planes_pointcloud   % the point cloud of the dataset.
Two-planes_groundtruth % the ground-truth of the dataset, planes are in different colors.   
Two-planes_boundary     % the boundaries among the planes in the dataset.
