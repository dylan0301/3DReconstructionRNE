    These are the high resolution result images of each method on the  synthetic datasets in the paper. Also,  pictures of the original point cloud and its ground-truth and boundary poins are given.
    There are six synthetic dataset: Tetrahedron, Pyramid, Octahedron, Boxtorus, Cuboctahedron, Octtorusâ€™The naming convention for the images is: datasetname-method. 

For example: 
Tetrahedron_pointcloud   % the point cloud of the dataset.
Tetrahedron_groundtruth % the ground-truth of the dataset, planes are in different colors.   
Tetrahedron_boundary     % the boundaries among the planes in the dataset.
