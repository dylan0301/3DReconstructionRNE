    These are the high resolution result images of the Section 4.3 for Permuted dataset analysis.
    The segmentation results of the permuted-order datasets with the original parameters, which differ from the results of the  original-order dataset. Which includes the six datasets:  Tetrahedron, Octtorus', Two-planes, Three-planes, House, and Cuboid.
    The naming convention for the images is: permuted-datasetname-parameter. 

For example: 
permuted_Two-planes_originalparameters   % the permuted-order Two-planes dataset with the original parameters.
permuted_Two-planes_roughlytunedparameters % the permuted-order Two-planes dataset with the roughly-tuned parameters.
